# Gauntlet-of-Worlds
Community Civs, but this time it is an entire ruleset. Anyone can design their own fantasy world to be featured in the maps of the Gauntlet of Worlds.
The idea is to have a lot of small worlds that are all distinct from each other separated by impassable tiles, with opening portals that appear around the edges of each world as the only option to traverse to other worlds. One of my ideas is to make this similar to community civs in spirit, allowing anyone to design their mini worlds and add them to the project (of course anyone is also free to have custom portal designs for their world
To summarize, every world needs:
- One or multiple custom and unique base terrains
- Custom bonus resources and one or two unique luxuries and optionally unique strategic resources, although those should be shared between multiple worlds
- One (or maybe 2 alternating) world border terrains that are impassable
- Rare Features, Vegetation and a custom hill design (optional)
- A shape it should come in (optional)
- A custom design for lit/unlit portals (Optional, alternatively you can choose between already available options for your world or can recolor existing ones)
